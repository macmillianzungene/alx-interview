# Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description

This project involves writing a function to rotate a given `n x n` 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The rotation must be done in-place, meaning the original matrix is modified directly and no new matrix is returned.

## Requirements

- Python 3.4.3 or later

## Usage

To use the function, import it into your Python script and call it with a 2D matrix as the argument.

### Function Prototype

```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    """
    Rotates an n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
    
    Parameters:
    matrix (list of list of int): The matrix to rotate.
    
    Returns:
    None: The matrix is modified in-place.
    """
